> 1. Alice in Borderland - * I like Alice in Borderland, because of its story and being made as a high quality movie, it is also very famous and while watching this movie it gives me some realization in life and also made me calm. Addiotionally, It is a commentary movies the dangers of technology and the impact it has on society. its main characters as their perspectives on life, death, survival, and friendship are tested and formed. I feel that im on their perspectives on life, death, survival, and friendship.
